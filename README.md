An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in PYTHON

I love the book << An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R>> by Gareth James • Daniela Witten • Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. Don't let R or Python stop you reading throught this book.  Please refer http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ for more details.

What I want to do here is to translate the R example into Python exmple. Don't let the language barriers stop you from exploring something fun and useful.
