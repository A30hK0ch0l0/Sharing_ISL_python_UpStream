An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in PYTHON

I love the book << An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R>> by Gareth James • Daniela Witten • Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. Don't let R or Python stop you reading throught this book.  Please refer https://www.statlearning.com/ for more details.

In 2nd Edition, the authors introduced a R library ISLR2 for all the dataset used in the book. In this repository, I have implemented the same/similar functionality in Python. Hope this could help this book reach more broad audience. Don't let the language barriers stop you from exploring something fun and useful.
