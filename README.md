An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in PYTHON

I love the book << An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R>> by Gareth James • Daniela Witten • Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. Don't let R or Python stop you reading throught this book. 

What I want to do here is to translate the R example into Python exmple.
