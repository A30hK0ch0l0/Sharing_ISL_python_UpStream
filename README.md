An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in PYTHON

I love the book << An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R>> by Gareth James • Daniela Witten • Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. And I see the demand of the book in the Python community. In this repository, I have implemented the same/similar functionality in Python. 

The code is in a script fomat to show the though process. Hope this could help this book reach more broad audience. *Don't let the language barriers stop you from exploring something fun and useful.*

Please refer https://www.statlearning.com/ for more details. In 2nd Edition, the authors introduced a R library ISLR2 for all the dataset used in the book.
